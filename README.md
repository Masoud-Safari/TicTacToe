# Tic Tac Toe for macOS

Welcome to the repository of my Tic Tac Toe game for macOS, developed using Swift and SwiftUI. This project showcases a classic game in a modern macOS application, demonstrating my understanding and application of Swift, SwiftUI, and AI game theory through the implementation of the Minimax algorithm.

## Features

- **Dynamic Start**: Each game round starts by randomly selecting who goes first - the computer or the user.
- **Smart AI**: The computer, playing as "O", uses a Minimax decision tree to calculate its moves, making it a challenging opponent that's tough to beat.
- **User-Friendly UI**: The game's interface is built entirely with SwiftUI, offering a clean and responsive experience.
- **Advanced Programming Concepts**: The project utilizes closures for passing information between views, showcasing advanced Swift programming techniques.

## How to Play

Playing is simple:
1. Launch the application.
2. The game will randomly decide whether you or the computer goes first.
3. You play as "X", and your goal is to get three in a row horizontally, vertically, or diagonally before the computer does.
4. Click on any empty square to make your move.
5. The game will alert you if you win, lose, or if it's a draw.

## Installation

To run this game on your macOS system, follow these steps:

1. Clone this repository to your local machine.
2. Open the project in Xcode.
3. Build and run the application.

## Learning Outcomes

This project deepened my understanding of:
- **Swift and SwiftUI**: By building this game, I gained practical experience in Swift programming and designing user interfaces with SwiftUI.
- **AI Game Theory**: Implementing the Minimax algorithm to create a challenging AI opponent.
- **Swift Advanced Features**: Utilizing closures to effectively pass data between views.
